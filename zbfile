GIL MISSIONS:
        == using stable baseline3 premade DQN ==
    1. run dqn and ddqn on toy environment (cartpole, mountain car, etc.)
        currently only works on cartpole, and does not exhibit the expected behavior
    2. run dqn and ddqn on flappy bird (or some other harder environment)

    3. once steps 1 and 2 are successful run the same with our own implemented code

train DQN and DOUBLE DQN for 10000 and average out the improvement plots

maybe take a pretrained CNN and fine tune it for the games
